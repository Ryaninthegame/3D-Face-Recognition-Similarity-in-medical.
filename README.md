# 3D-Face-Recognition-Similarity-in-medical.
* Cooperate with Chang Gung Memorial Hospital in medical imaging applications, using SimCLR for face similarity recognition.
* Our dataset of project is contour map of face, so I don't think to need Resnte-50 to extract feature.
* I implement SimCLR model, utilize concept of SimCLR, and slightly adjust original SimCLR model.
